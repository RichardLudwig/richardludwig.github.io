title: Duolingo, Google Translate, and Reading Online

I learned to read HSK1 Mandarin Chinese in a month, from mid-December 2024 to mid-January 2025. I exclusively used Duolingo to acquire enough knowledge of Chinese characters and radicals so I could read sentences like "The dog goes to the park." When I see a character I don't recognize, I copy and paste it into Google Translate and memorize the English-translated meaning. I achieved this goal by focusing on existing learning resources and considering the overall task possbile, despite Mandarin's reputation of being the most difficult language to learn. Why overcomplicate goals when simple methods can be just as effective?
